1. Installation

Windows
 - Download and extract 4PairsofGlassesand12BadEyes.zip
 - Navigate into the extracted folder. You will see a folder called
   "windows-x64". Navigate there.
 - In the folder, you will see two executables, "GetGoingDesktop.exe"* and 
   "GetGoingMobile.exe"*
 - Run these files to run the application. You may need to install the
   Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 runtime libraries available at:

   https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

* if Windows prevents you from opening the files, click 'More info' and then
  'Run anyway'
* The executables were compiled for Windows 10 64 bit

Android
 - Install the application from the Google Play Store:

  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.qtproject.example.mobile_app

2. Functionality
With Get Going, users can do the following:
 - Create an account to Get Started
 - View suggested events (based on interests selected during account creation)
   and join them
 - Get matched with other users who are attending the same event
 - View matches
 - Create a host account that is able to create new events

3. Tutorial
 - Click "Get Started" and fill out your information under "Sign Up, It's Free!"
   to register for an account.
 - Be sure to fill out all of your interests on the "What Interests You?" page.
   This will influence what events are suggested.
 - After you have created a regular account, you can upgrade it to a host
   account in the "Interested in being a host?" section.
 - You can login to a created account on the "Login or Sign Up" page.
 - After logging in as a user, you will see events you have joined under
   "My Event Stream" at the top left. Suggested events will show up under
   "My Interest Stream" at the bottom left.
 - To join an event, simply double click an event you see under
   "My Interest Stream". After clicking "Refresh My Events", you will see the
   event show up in "My Event Stream".
 - To get matched with a date, double click on the event in "My Event Stream".
   You will recieve a message on whether or not the match was a success.
 - To view your dates, click the "See Dates" button on the right side of the
   application.
 - With a host account, you can navigate to the "Host" tab and click
   "Create Event" to make new events.
   
 - The mobile app has very similar functionality to the desktop app.

4. Things to Avoid and Known Issues
 - "Get Verified" does nothing useful
 - If your connection with the server gets dropped, you will have to restart the
   desktop application (the mobile app handles it).
 - A poor connection can make the make updates/refreshes take a long time.
 - Do not join events multiple times or find multiple matches for the same event
 - Android displays some widgets incorrectly, specifically the date choosers
   (a bug with Qt)
